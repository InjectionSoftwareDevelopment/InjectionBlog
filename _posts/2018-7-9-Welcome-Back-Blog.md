#### Welcome Back Blog!

It's been awhile since I have done a blog post. As you likely know by now if you've been following the Injection youtube channel or either the 3ndG4me or InjectionDev twitter accounts, I do most of my updates via videos and tweets.

Wordpress was, is, and always will be a hot smelly pile of garbage. With that said, it was at least an easy and convienent way to blog. However, I always wrote blog posts as more of a bad marketing and promotional stint for my apps or tutorials. From now on these blog posts are reserved for more technical updates.

While I may still write a blog post for a big release or something via Injeciton, this blog will primarily be a place where I do CTF writeups, publish cool research-like content, and maybe even write some motivational/inspirational pieces in relation to my field of study. No more third person "we here at Injection" stuff, just clear, purposeful posts from me or any partners I have for various content creation mediums.

Injection is a foundation of sorts that I have always relied on for content creation. It's always been just me pulling the strings in the background, and it's primarily been a portfolio upon which I've built my career. Injection isn't a business, and it's not a collective, it's just the fundamental medium I have established to be able to work with others and create cool things related to computer science without having to worry about too many business logistics.

These new blogs will be more personal, more profane (whoops), and more about expressing my thoughts in a way that actually serves a purpose. Much like my video content, these blogs will hopefully be a way that people who enjoy the content I publish via Injection, to learn and grow as I do. The write ups and tutorials posted here I hope will be a great benefit to the computer and information security community, and the software I release I hope will benefit others the same way it does for me.

This new blog is made using jekyll and is hosted via github pages. This means my posts will have rich markdown content, and be more engaging and hopefully more fun to read. Shout out to my friend @DMFR for pointing me in this much better direction (if you're interested in doing this yourself check out the [jeykll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project on github, alternatively [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) is another good solution that my friend suggested)

I have also integrated with disqus so any one who actually gives a damn about following my stuff, or anyone who feels the need to voice their opinion against me, and leave comments and have discussions regarding various articles posted here (just like an actual blog). I honestly likely won't moderate these comments very much, trolls and shitposting don't bother me, and the internet is the wild west I don't have time to babysit everyone. I do discourage such behavior, but you can't polish a turd. I'll always be open and responsive to quality critiscm and disagreement, as well as support and friendly conversation, so basically if you're a decent human, even if we don't see eye to eye, I'll likely see your posts and engage in conversation with you.

Same shit goes for my youtube channel. Just as my mom, aunts, and grandmother always remind me, "be nice or folks won't like ya". I'll do my best to return the genuine sentiment, because it warms my heart when total strangers give a damn about the stuff I put my passion and free time into.

Welcome back to the new and improved Injection Blog! You can find all the old shitty blogs [here](https://injectionweb.wordpress.com), I'll leave them up indefinitely, but don't go there looking for the new shit, all the new shit is here yo.

Looking forward to posting more in the future, for now, this is the start!
