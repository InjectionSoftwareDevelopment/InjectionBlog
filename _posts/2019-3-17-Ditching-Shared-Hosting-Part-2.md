#### Ditching Shared Hosting Part 2

I made a post back in 2018 about how I was ditching shared hosting and moving everything to Github Pages, you can read that [here](https://injectionsoftwaredevelopment.github.io/injection-blog/Ditching-Shared-Hosting/).

This post is a follow up to that, I have finally gotten myself in a place where the move makes sense and I have pulled the trigger on quite a few items.

Currently all my email services have been transferred so I am not relying on my shared host, so now all that's left is transferring my domain. Then once all of that is hooked up to Github Pages everything is great right?

Well almost, there actually a few more changes I am making, some of which are related to email that I have already made.

Over the next few weeks I will be cancelling my Apple Developer account. I no longer have the desire or capacity to support my existing apps anymore and they are becoming dated as time passes. This change comes from the fact that I have pivoted heavily into security and almost 100% of the tools I write are CLI and don't need to be distributed via any app store.

With that said, Injection is still a "software development project", still going to make a lot of software, it's just going to be security focused most of the time.

This is just where my new passion is, and considering I don't have a massive user base utlizing my mobile apps, this is definitely the direction as many security folks do utilize my other projects.

With that said, I'm not leaving forever. I still have some very long term indy game projects in the works that I would love to distribute via all App Stores, but there's no sense in me paying $100 a year while I wait for those to come to fruitiion. When those projects are ready, I will establish a newer, more professional presence on any digital mediums that I distribute those with.

For now my developer fee is going towards things like GSuite, and Hack the Box, where I get more productivity and focus on my actual passions.

As my old apps are phased out I would like to say THANK YOU to all who have supported me during my noobish development phases. Go snag a copy of Stickman Joe: The Adventure, while it still exists!

Apps that will be discontinued:
- Triad
- Stickman Joe: The Adventure
- Acuity
- Stickman Joe: Rocket Joe
- Stickman Joe: Parkour Adventure


There is no official date on when this will be pulled, so go snag 'em while you can. The apps that are on Android should be avaialable on Android indefinitely, though many services such as the Acuity Docs, Acuity Requests, and Stickman Joe API will no longer work.

With that all said, expect some intermiitent issues on the site, trust me, I know, and I'm working on it. I'm expecting a smooth transition with all this, but we all know that won't happen.
